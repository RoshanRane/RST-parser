# RST-parser
An automatic RST parser implemented using neural networks. This team-project is done as part of the Masters course ANLP at the University of Potsdam.
The parser is trained and tested on wall-street-journal corpus.

The whole project is divided into 2 sections :
1) Segmentation
2) Parsing

Files :
1) RST-00-corpus-reader : Contains Feature extractions for the Segmentor Neural Network
2) RST-01-EDU-segmenter : Segmentor implementation and results.
3) RST-02-parser : Feature extraction for Parsing and Parser results. 
4) rst.py : Parser implementation

The guide to use each notebook is provided in the notebook itself.
